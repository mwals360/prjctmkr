# prjctmkr

- utility written on/for Atari TOS to help me keep a project folder organized
- pretty hacky in some places; I make no claims about quality, portability, or perfection
- compile it and run 'prjctmkr h' for the help menu

- only tested in [Hatari](https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/) v2.5.0 running [EmuTOS](https://emutos.sourceforge.io/) 1.2.1
- if you find any bugs, please report it, but I won't promise any fixes; at least others could avoid some traps in the future
